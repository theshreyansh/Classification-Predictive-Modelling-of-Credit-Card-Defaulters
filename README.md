# Classification & Predictive Modelling of Credit Card Defaulters
<p>Domain: Finance & Risk Analytics</p>
<p>Skills: Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, Neural Networks, R, Machine Learning</p>
<p>Description: <li>The objective of the project is to identify customers who can default their payments. This will help the financial institutions to take corrective actions and mitigate the financial risk. The prediction will be done through various analytical methods like machine learning models which are robust and accurate</li>
<li>Models run here are Logistic Regression, Naive-Bayes, Random Forest, and SVM classifiers.Unknown values imputed using MICE package in R.Imbalanced data handled using ROSE package in R.Clustering using correlation between features (better result than clustering using ClustofVar package) Classification using cluster scores calculated using GLRM gives best Sensitivity (70%) and Specificity (70%) so far. ïƒ˜ Best performing algorithm is Logistic Regression among it, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and SVM with radial basis kernel.</li></p>
